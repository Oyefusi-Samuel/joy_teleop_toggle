A universal and lightweight ROS 2 Python node for joystick teleoperation with toggle control and dynamic velocity scaling.  
Designed for **mobile robotics**, it supports all major controllers like DualShock 4, Xbox, and Logitech Gamepads â€” and is compatible with **ROS 2 Foxy, Galactic, Humble, Iron**, and more.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Toggle teleoperation ON/OFF with a button.
- Control **linear velocity** using the left joystick.
- Control **angular velocity** using the right joystick.
- Dynamically adjust linear and angular velocity levels.
- Debounced buttons to prevent accidental changes.
- Automatically launches `joy_node` driver if needed.
- Publishes to `/cmd_vel` using `geometry_msgs/Twist`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Ensure your system has:

- ROS 2 (tested on Foxy, Galactic, Humble)
- `joy` package (for joystick support)

Install the joystick driver if not already available:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-<ros2-distro>-joy

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ROS2 workspace `src` folder:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/joy_teleop_toggle.git

2. Build the package with colcon:

   ```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select joy_teleop_toggle --symlink-install
Replace <ros2-distro> with your distribution (e.g. foxy, humble, iron).

3. Source your workspace:

source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

Source your workspace:

    source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

Usage

Connect your DualShock 4 controller (wired or wireless) and run:

ros2 run joy_teleop_toggle joy_teleop_toggle

    Press the Circle button (Button 1) to toggle teleoperation ON/OFF.

    Use the left joystick (vertical axis) to move forward/backward.

    Use the right joystick (horizontal axis) to turn left/right.

    Press R2 (Button 7) to increase linear speed.

    Press L2 (Button 6) to decrease linear speed.

    Press R1 (Button 5) to increase angular speed.

    Press L1 (Button 4) to decrease angular speed.

Current velocity scales will be printed in the terminal when changed.

Button Mapping Summary
Function	Button / Axis
Toggle teleop	Circle (Button 1)
Increase linear vel	R2 (Button 7)
Decrease linear vel	L2 (Button 6)
Increase angular vel	R1 (Button 5)
Decrease angular vel	L1 (Button 4)
Linear velocity	Left joystick vertical (axes[1])
Angular velocity	Right joystick horizontal (axes[3])

# Dependencies

    ROS 2 (tested on Humble/Foxy/Galactic)
